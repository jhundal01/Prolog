# Prolog
CSC344 class project
The task is to fly a drone through a dark cave, recording your path so that future drones can fly through at high rates of speed while avoiding obstacles. Of course, being a computer scientist the aim is to automate this path finding. The program (in Prolog) flies the drone, slowly, through the cave, maneuvering around obstacles, and recording the path taken.
